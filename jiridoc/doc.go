Jiri cl - Manage project changelists

Manage project changelists.

Usage:
   jiri cl [flags] <command>

The jiri cl commands are:
   cleanup     Clean up changelists that have been merged
   mail        Mail a changelist for review
   new         Create a new local branch for a changelist

   Use color to format output.
 -v=false
   Print verbose output.

Jiri cl cleanup - Clean up changelists that have been merged

Command "cleanup" checks that the given branches have been merged into the
corresponding remote branch. If a branch differs from the corresponding remote
branch, the command reports the difference and stops. Otherwise, it deletes the
given branches.

Usage:
   jiri cl cleanup [flags] <branches>

<branches> is a list of branches to cleanup.

The jiri cl cleanup flags are:
 -f=false
   Ignore unmerged changes.

   Use color to format output.
 -v=false
   Print verbose output.

Jiri cl mail - Mail a changelist for review

Command "mail" squashes all commits of a local branch into a single "changelist"
and mails this changelist to Gerrit as a single commit. First time the command
is invoked, it generates a Change-Id for the changelist, which is appended to
the commit message. Consecutive invocations of the command use the same
Change-Id by default, informing Gerrit that the incomming commit is an update of
an existing changelist.

Usage:
   jiri cl mail [flags]

The jiri cl mail flags are:
 -autosubmit=false
   Automatically submit the changelist when feasible.
 -cc=
   Comma-seperated list of emails or LDAPs to cc.
 -check-uncommitted=true
   Check that no uncommitted changes exist.
 -d=false
   Send a draft changelist.
 -edit=true
   Open an editor to edit the CL description.
 -host=
   Gerrit host to use.  Defaults to gerrit host specified in manifest.
 -m=
   CL description.

   The type of presubmit tests to run. Valid values: none,all.
 -r=
   Comma-seperated list of emails or LDAPs to request review.
 -remote-branch=master
   Name of the remote branch the CL pertains to, without the leading "origin/".
 -set-topic=true
   Set Gerrit CL topic.
 -topic=
   CL topic, defaults to <username>-<branchname>.
 -verify=true
   Run pre-push git hooks.

 -color=true
   Use color to format output.
 -v=false
   Print verbose output.

Jiri cl new - Create a new local branch for a changelist

Command "new" creates a new local branch for a changelist. In particular, it
forks a new branch with the given name from the current branch and records the
relationship between the current branch and the new branch in the .jiri metadata
directory. The information recorded in the .jiri metadata directory tracks
dependencies between CLs and is used by the "jiri cl sync" and "jiri cl mail"
commands.

Usage:
   jiri cl new [flags] <name>

<name> is the changelist name.

The jiri cl new flags are:
 -color=true
   Use color to format output.
 -v=false
   Print verbose output.

Jiri cl sync - Bring a changelist up to date

Command "sync" brings the CL identified by the current branch up to date with
the branch tracking the remote branch this CL pertains to. To do that, the
command uses the information recorded in the .jiri metadata directory to
identify the sequence of dependent CLs leading to the current branch. The
command then iterates over this sequence bringing each of the CLs up to date
with its ancestor. The end result of this process is that all CLs in the
sequence are up to date with the branch that tracks the remote branch this CL
pertains to.

NOTE: It is possible that the command cannot automatically merge changes in an
ancestor into its dependent. When that occurs, the command is aborted and prints
instructions that need to be followed before the command can be retried.

Usage:
   jiri cl sync [flags]

The jiri cl sync flags are:
 -remote-branch=master
   Name of the remote branch the CL pertains to, without the leading "origin/".

 -color=true
   Use color to format output.
 -v=false
   Print verbose output.

Jiri import

Command "import" adds imports to the $JIRI_ROOT/.jiri_manifest file, which
specifies manifest information for the jiri tool.  The file is created if it
doesn't already exist, otherwise additional imports are added to the existing
file.

An <import> element is added to the manifest representing a remote manifest
import.  The manifest file path is relative to the root directory of the remote
import repository.

Example:
  $ jiri import myfile https://foo.com/bar.git

Run "jiri help manifest" for details on manifests.

Usage:
   jiri import [flags] <manifest> <remote>

<manifest> specifies the manifest file to use.

 -out=
   The output file.  Uses $JIRI_ROOT/.jiri_manifest if unspecified.  Uses stdout
   if set to "-".
 -overwrite=false
   Write a new .jiri_manifest file with the given specification.  If it already
   exists, the existing content will be ignored and the file will be
   overwritten.
 -protocol=git
   The version control protocol used by the remote manifest project.
 -remote-branch=master
   The branch of the remote manifest project to track, without the leading
   "origin/".

Run a command in parallel across one or more jiri projects using the specified
profile target's environment. Commands are run using the shell specified by the
users $SHELL environment variable, or "sh" if that's not set. Thus commands are
run as $SHELL -c "args..."

Usage:
   jiri runp [flags] <command line>

Jiri dockergo - Execute the go command in a docker container

Executes a Go command in a docker container. This is primarily aimed at the
builds of Linux binaries and libraries where there is a dependence on cgo. This
allows for compilation (and cross-compilation) without polluting the host
filesystem with compilers, C-headers, libraries etc. as dependencies are
encapsulated in the docker image.

The docker image is expected to have the appropriate C-compiler and any
pre-built headers/libraries to be linked in.  It is also expected to have the
appropriate environment variables (such as CGO_ENABLED, CGO_CFLAGS etc) set.

Sample usage on *all* platforms (Linux/OS X):

Build the "./foo" package for the host architecture and linux (command works
from OS X as well):

    jiri-dockergo build

Build for linux/arm from any host (including OS X):

    GOARCH=arm jiri-dockergo build

For more information on docker see https://www.docker.com.

For more information on the design of this particular tool including the
definitions of default images, see:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ud-QUVOjsaya57kgq0j24wDwTzKKE7o_PShQQs0DR5w/edit?usp=sharing

While the targets are built using the toolchain in the docker image, a local Go
installation is still required for Vanadium-specific compilation prep work -
such as invoking the VDL compiler on packages to generate up-to-date .go files.

Jiri profile-v23 - Manage v23 profiles

Profiles are used to manage external sofware dependencies and offer a balance
between providing no support at all and a full blown package manager. Profiles
can be built natively as well as being cross compiled. A profile is a named
collection of software required for a given system component or application.
Current example profiles include 'syncbase' which consists of the leveldb and
snappy libraries or 'android' which consists of all of the android components
and downloads needed to build android applications. Profiles are built for
specific targets.

Targets

Profiles generally refer to uncompiled source code that needs to be compiled for
a specific "target". Targets hence represent compiled code and consist of:

1. An 'architecture' that refers to the CPU to be generate code for

2. An 'operating system' that refers to the operating system to generate code
for

3. A lexicographically orderd set of supported versions, one of which is
designated as the default.

4. An 'environment' which is a set of environment variables to use when
compiling the profile

Targets thus provide the basic support needed for cross compilation.

Targets are versioned and multiple versions may be installed and used
simultaneously. Versions are ordered lexicographically and each target specifies
a 'default' version to be used when a specific version is not explicitly
requested. A request to 'upgrade' the profile will result in the installation of
the default version of the targets currently installed if that default version
is not already installed.

The Supported Commands

Profiles, or more correctly, targets for specific profiles may be installed or
removed. When doing so, the name of the profile is required, but the other
components of the target are optional and will default to the values of the
system that the commands are run on (so-called native builds) and the default
version for that target. Once a profile is installed it may be referred to by
its tag for subsequent removals.

The are also update and cleanup commands. Update installs the default version of
the requested profile or for all profiles for the already installed targets.
Cleanup will uninstall targets whose version is older than the default.

Finally, there are commands to list the available and installed profiles and to
access the environment variables specified and stored in each profile
installation and a command (recreate) to generate a list of commands that can be
run to recreate the currently installed profiles.

The Profiles Database

The profiles packages manages a database that tracks the installed profiles and
their configurations. Other command line tools and packages are expected to read
information about the currently installed profiles from this database via the
profiles package. The profile command line tools support displaying the database
(via the list command) or for specifying an alternate version of the file (via
the -profiles-db flag) which is generally useful for debugging.

Adding Profiles

Profiles are intended to be provided as go packages that register themselves
with the profile command line tools via the *v.io/jiri/profiles* package. They
must implement the interfaces defined by that package and be imported (e.g.
import _ "myprofile") by the command line tools that are to use them.

Jiri filesystem - Description of jiri file system layout

All data managed by the jiri tool is located in the file system under a root
directory, colloquially called the jiri root directory.  The file system layout
looks like this:

 [root]                              # root directory (name picked by user)
 [root]/.jiri_root                   # root metadata directory
 [root]/.jiri_root/bin               # contains tool binaries (jiri, etc.)
 [root]/.jiri_root/update_history    # contains history of update snapshots
 [root]/.manifest                    # contains jiri manifests
 [root]/[project1]                   # project directory (name picked by user)
 [root]/[project1]/.jiri             # project metadata directory
 [root]/[project1]/.jiri/metadata.v2 # project metadata file
 [root]/[project1]/.jiri/<<cls>>     # project per-cl metadata directories
 [root]/[project1]/<<files>>         # project files
 [root]/[project2]...

The [root] and [projectN] directory names are picked by the user.  The <<cls>>
are named via jiri cl new, and the <<files>> are named as the user adds files
and directories to their project.  All other names above have special meaning to
the jiri tool, and cannot be changed; you must ensure your path names don't
collide with these special names.

There are two ways to run the jiri tool:

1) Shim script (recommended approach).  This is a shell script that looks for
the [root] directory.  If the JIRI_ROOT environment variable is set, that is
assumed to be the [root] directory.  Otherwise the script looks for the
.jiri_root directory, starting in the current working directory and walking up
the directory chain.  The search is terminated successfully when the .jiri_root
directory is found; it fails after it reaches the root of the file system.  Thus
the shim must be invoked from the [root] directory or one of its subdirectories.

Once the [root] is found, the JIRI_ROOT environment variable is set to its
location, and [root]/.jiri_root/bin/jiri is invoked.  That file contains the
actual jiri binary.

The point of the shim script is to make it easy to use the jiri tool with
multiple [root] directories on your file system.  Keep in mind that when "jiri
update" is run, the jiri tool itself is automatically updated along with all
projects.  By using the shim script, you only need to remember to invoke the
jiri tool from within the appropriate [root] directory, and the projects and
tools under that [root] directory will be updated.

The shim script is located at [root]/release/go/src/v.io/jiri/scripts/jiri

2) Direct binary.  This is the jiri binary, containing all of the actual jiri
tool logic.  The binary requires the JIRI_ROOT environment variable to point to
the [root] directory.

Note that if you have multiple [root] directories on your file system, you must
remember to run the jiri binary corresponding to the setting of your JIRI_ROOT
environment variable.  Things may fail if you mix things up, since the jiri
binary is updated with each call to "jiri update", and you may encounter version
mismatches between the jiri binary and the various metadata files or other
logic.  This is the reason the shim script is recommended over running the
binary directly.

The jiri binary is located at [root]/.jiri_root/bin/jiri

Jiri manifest - Description of manifest files

Jiri manifest files describe the set of projects that get synced and tools that
get built when running "jiri update".

The first manifest file that jiri reads is in $JIRI_ROOT/.jiri_manifest.  This
manifest **must** exist for the jiri tool to work.

Usually the manifest in $JIRI_ROOT/.jiri_manifest will import other manifests
from remote repositories via <import> tags, but it can contain its own list of
projects and tools as well.

Manifests have the following XML schema:

<manifest>
  <imports>
    <import remote="https://vanadium.googlesource.com/manifest"
            manifest="public"
            name="manifest"
    />
    <localimport file="/path/to/local/manifest"/>
    ...
  </imports>
  <projects>
    <project name="my-project"
             path="path/where/project/lives"
             protocol="git"
             remote="https://github.com/myorg/foo"
             revision="ed42c05d8688ab23"
             remotebranch="my-branch"
             gerrithost="https://myorg-review.googlesource.com"
             githooks="path/to/githooks-dir"
             runhook="path/to/runhook-script"
    />
    ...
  </projects>
  <tools>
    <tool name="jiri"
          package="v.io/jiri"
          project="release.go.jiri"
    />
    ...
  </tools>
</manifest>

The <import> and <localimport> tags can be used to share common projects and
tools across multiple manifests.

A <localimport> tag should be used when the manifest being imported and the
importing manifest are both in the same repository, or when neither one is in a
repository.  The "file" attribute is the path to the manifest file being
imported.  It can be absolute, or relative to the importing manifest file.

If the manifest being imported and the importing manifest are in different
repositories then an <import> tag must be used, with the following attributes:

* remote (required) - The remote url of the repository containing the manifest
to be imported

* manifest (required) - The path of the manifest file to be imported, relative
to the repository root.

* name (optional) - The name of the project corresponding to the manifest
repository.  If your manifest contains a <project> with the same remote as the
manifest remote, then the "name" attribute of on the <import> tag should match
the "name" attribute on the <project>.  Otherwise, jiri will clone the manifest
repository on every update.

The <project> tags describe the projects to sync, and what state they should
sync to, accoring to the following attributes:

* name (required) - The name of the project.

* path (required) - The location where the project will be located, relative to
the jiri root.

* remote (required) - The remote url of the project repository.

* protocol (optional) - The protocol to use when cloning and syncing the repo.
Currently "git" is the default and only supported protocol.

* remotebranch (optional) - The remote branch that the project will sync to.
Defaults to "master".  The "remotebranch" attribute is ignored if "revision" is
specified.

* revision (optional) - The specific revision (usually a git SHA) that the
project will sync to.  If "revision" is  specified then the "remotebranch"
attribute is ignored.

* gerrithost (optional) - The url of the Gerrit host for the project.  If
specified, then running "jiri cl mail" will upload a CL to this Gerrit host.

* githooks (optional) - The path (relative to $JIRI_ROOT) of a directory
containing git hooks that will be installed in the projects .git/hooks directory
during each update.

* runhook (optional) - The path (relate to $JIRI_ROOT) of a script that will be
run during each update.

The <tool> tags describe the tools that will be compiled and installed in
$JIRI_ROOT/.jiri_root/bin after each update.  The tools must be written in go,
and are identified by their package name and the project that contains their
code.  They are configured via the following attributes:

* name (required) - The name of the binary that will be installed in
  JIRI_ROOT/.jiri_root/bin

* package (required) - The name of the Go package that will be passed to "go
  build".

* project (required) - The name of the project that contains the source code
  for the tool.
